## Step-01: Introduction
1. Create Cloud Storage Bucket
2. Enable Object Versioning
3. Upload and Verify OBJECT VERSIONING
4. Also verify RESTORE operation

## Step-02: Create Cloud Storage Bucket, Enable OBJECT VERSIONING
```t
# Create Cloud Storage Bucket
gcloud storage buckets create gs://mybucket1012

# Enable Object Versioning
Goto Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> PROTECTION Tab
Enable OBJECT VERSIONING

# Review OLM (LIFECYCLE) Rules creatd by default
Goto Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> LIFECYCLE Tab
1. Delete object: Object is noncurrent 2+ newer versions
2. Delete object: 7+ days since object became noncurrent
```
## Step-03: Upload multiple versions of file and Verify OBJECT VERSIONING
```t
# V1: Create, Upload and Verify
1. echo "myapp v1" > version-demo.txt
2. gcloud storage cp version-demo.txt gs://mybucket1012
3. Go to Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> VERSION HISTORY Tab
4. Verify current version by accessing object
Goto Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> LIVE OBJECT Tab -> Authenticated URL 
Observation: should see "myapp v1"


# V2: Create, Upload and Verify
1. echo "myapp v2" > version-demo.txt
2. gcloud storage cp version-demo.txt gs://mybucket1012
3. Go to Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> VERSION HISTORY Tab
4. Verify current version by accessing object
Goto Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> LIVE OBJECT Tab -> Authenticated URL 
Observation: should see "myapp v2"

# List All versions of Objects
gcloud storage ls --all-versions gs://mybucket1012
gcloud storage ls --all-versions gs://mybucket1012 --long
gcloud storage ls --all-versions gs://mybucket1012 --full
```

## Step-04: Verify by running RESTORE
```t
# Restore Object
1. Go to Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> VERSION HISTORY Tab
2. Click on RESTORE for older version "myapp v1"
3. Observation: New version of object should be created as LIVE OBJECT
4. Verify current version by accessing object
Goto Cloud Storage -> mybucket1012 -> version-demo.txt -> LIVE OBJECT Tab -> Authenticated URL 
Observation: should see "myapp v1"
```
